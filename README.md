LappyTag: Intelligent Laptop Price Prediction

LappyTag is a machine learning-based application that predicts laptop prices based on user-selected specifications. This intuitive web app, built using Streamlit, empowers consumers, retailers, and tech reviewers to assess prices across a wide range of laptop configurations quickly and accurately.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features
Brand & Model Selection: Choose from popular laptop brands and models, including gaming, business, and ultrabook types.
Hardware Specifications: Input RAM, CPU, storage (HDD/SSD), and GPU to specify laptop configurations.
Display Options: Customize display features with options for touchscreen, IPS technology, screen size, and resolution (auto-calculated PPI for accurate display assessment).
Instant Price Prediction: Powered by a trained machine learning model, LappyTag offers quick and precise price estimates with just one click.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit, the application is designed for seamless user interaction, providing immediate results in an accessible format.

ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used
Python â€“ Core programming language.
Pandas & NumPy â€“ Data processing and numerical computations.
Scikit-Learn â€“ Model training and prediction.
Streamlit â€“ Framework for creating an interactive web application.
Pickle â€“ Model persistence for efficient loading and execution.

ðŸ”¹ Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to set up LappyTag locally:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/hardiksharma0511/LappyTag.git
cd LappyTag

2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the application:
streamlit run app.py

After starting, the application will open in your browser, usually at http://localhost:8501.


ðŸ”¹ How It Works
LappyTag leverages a machine learning pipeline trained on a dataset of laptop specifications and prices. The pipeline preprocesses features like brand, CPU, GPU, and display properties, and applies a regression model to predict prices accurately.

Key Components
Feature Engineering: Categorical encoding, binary encoding for touchscreen/IPS, and display PPI calculation.
Model: Regression model fine-tuned to deliver accurate predictions.

ðŸ”¹ Project Goals
Accurate Price Prediction: Reliable price estimates for various laptop configurations.
Enhanced User Experience: Simple, intuitive UI for smooth interaction.
Real-World Application: Targeted for e-commerce, retail, and tech journalism use cases.

ðŸ”¹ Why LappyTag?
LappyTag exemplifies the use of machine learning in solving practical, industry-relevant challenges. The project highlights skills in:
Data Science & Machine Learning: Effective feature engineering, model training, and validation.
Web Application Development: Streamlit-powered UI for accessibility and ease of use.
Real-World Relevance: LappyTag can be applied across various fields, from retail analysis to personalized consumer assistance.
